-The current issue (as of 1/8/12) is that when convolving (multiplying the fft output of the image and the filter image) the output has a component that is rotated 180 degrees. I cannot figure out where that is coming from but it is definitely a result of the multiplication of the ffts because if I remove that part then there is no flipping (of course the filter then has no effect either.

//Done
-write an inverse dft function to recreate the images from the frequency and phase data
-incorporate phase data saving into the current dft function
-implement fast fourier instead of dft
-test convolution with an image and a filter as explained in the imagemagick site tutorial (the long one with the blue background, can be found on instapaper)
