-write an inverse dft function to recreate the images from the frequency and phase data
-incorporate phase data saving into the current dft function
-implement fast fourier instead of dft
-test convolution with an image and a filter as explained in the imagemagick site tutorial (the long one with the blue background, can be found on instapaper)
